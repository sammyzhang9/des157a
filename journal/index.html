            The article "Best Practices for Form Design" by Salim Ansari highlights how good form design can make or break user experiences. One of my key takeaways from the article is the notion of keeping things simple and only asking for the most essential information. This approach minimizes the mental effort users need to fill out forms. Another important point is using a single column layout, which keeps everything in a logical, easy-to-follow order, which makes completing the form more effecient. Usability studies and eye tracking research have been conducted to back it up, showing that single column forms are easier to navigate than multi column ones. The article also suggests that breaking long forms into shorter, multi-page steps to make them feel less overwhelming. Alongside multi-pages, having a progress bar also boosts user attention. Overall the article helped me understand the best practices when making a design for a form.

            For example, airtable uses good design practices when designing their forms. It follows a single row column and keeps placeholder text below the text input field.
