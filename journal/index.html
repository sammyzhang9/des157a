        <h2>Game Design Research</h2>
        <time datetime="2025-03-17">March 17, 2025</time>
        <p>
            Reading through Juego Studio's article on game design principles, I found a lot of points that stood out to me. One of the biggest takeaways was the importance of setting clear goals for players. I’ve worked on projects where this was overlooked, and the result was a confusing experience where players didn’t know what to do next. Another interesting point was about keeping core mechanics simple and engaging. It’s easy to want to add a ton of features, thinking it’ll make the game better, but more often than not, it just overwhelms players. The article also talks about game flow, which is something I’ve learned to appreciate more over time. A clunky UI or poorly timed interruptions can break immersion really fast. I’ve played  games where the interface was too complicated, which pulled me out of the experience instead of drawing me in. Overall, the article does a great job of laying out the fundamentals of good game design and helped in in creating my own game.

        <h2>Visual Thinking Analysis</h2>

            For this assignment I was paired up with Richie Huang. Richie’s pictures are centered around the California Lighting Technology Center’s light fixtures. He choose four pictures, each showcasing a unique lamp or light pendant. What’s interesting about these pictures is the ambiance each light fixture brings to the background. The light reflects back onto the room depending on the certain curves or material of the light fixture. Each lamp holds a unique shape that is completely different from the next, which creates a really dynamic visual contrast throughout the serious but still keeping the theme centralized around one type of object. The most obvious aspect of these images is the subject matter itself, the light fixtures as the focal point to each picture. I think potential for exploration is more within how the light interacting with the surrounding environment, whether it be how it diffuse light, shadows, and reflections. I think Richie can explore how the lighting influences the mood of a space.

            For my image, I believe this is really interesting because there is a lot of potential space around the subject matter that I can utilize with surrounding designs. The open sky and ocean all tie together with a sense of vastness while the concrete frames the scene. I think it’s interesting how the subject, the girl holding the camera, is both apart of the scene but also observing it herself. I want to explore ways to integrate design elements that mimic the framing of Japanese architecture technique of turning a landscape into a contained visual experience. I think I could experiment with cropping and composition adjustments to emphasize the natural framing. I could also overlap subtle geometric shapes or whitespace elements to reinforce the idea of contained perspectives.

            As a designer, I believe visual literacy to be incredibly powerful and beautiful when utilized well. When given content that is purely visual, it invokes the audience to interpret, consider, and then draw their own conclusion while highlighting a designers capability to tell a story within images. <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards.com</a> is one of my personal favorite sites to look for design inspiration, I can always turn to it whenever I need some creative inspiration. There are some really quirky and fun projects I’ve found just browsing through it in my spare time, like a whole site for a small restaurant in Spain that allows users to draw freely in the background while looking at their menu. I even have a notion page in my personal home thats for my favorite <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards.com</a> sites! While looking at this week’s highlighted sites, <a href="https://www.microdot.vision/">microdot.vision</a> caught my attention for this Learning Journal prompt. The site places core emphasis on the visual representation of their projects. Rather than paragraphs of text, or taglines, or headers explaining what the project is, they let the work speak for itself. Because of this, they can create incredibly engaging visuals while allowing me to be curious to learn more about what they do.

        <h2>Best Practice for Modals/Overlays/Dialog Windows</h2>
        <time datetime="2025-01-30">January 30, 2025</time>
        <p>
            Naema Baskanderi’s article, “Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows,” breaks down how modals can be useful but are often overused in ways that hurt the user experience. Modals are meant to grab attention, collect input, or provide extra information without taking users to a new page. However, when used too frequently or without clear exit options, they can be frustrating. One of the biggest takeaways is the need to make modals easy to close. Users should have multiple ways to dismiss them—like a visible 'close' button, clicking outside the modal, or pressing the 'escape' key. The article also highlights that modals should be well-labeled and not take up too much screen space, especially on mobile, where they can quickly become annoying. The article made me think more carefully about when and how to use modals. It’s a great reminder that just because modals are a common UI pattern doesn’t mean they’re always the best choice. Keeping them minimal, easy to close, and mindful of the user's flow can make a big difference in improving the experience.

        <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
        <time datetime="2025-01-20">January 20, 2025</time>
        <p>
            The article "Best Practices for Form Design" by Salim Ansari highlights how good form design can make or break user experiences. One of my key takeaways from the article is the notion of keeping things simple and only asking for the most essential information. This approach minimizes the mental effort users need to fill out forms. Another important point is using a single column layout, which keeps everything in a logical, easy-to-follow order, which makes completing the form more effecient. Usability studies and eye tracking research have been conducted to back it up, showing that single column forms are easier to navigate than multi column ones. The article also suggests that breaking long forms into shorter, multi-page steps to make them feel less overwhelming. Alongside multi-pages, having a progress bar also boosts user attention. Overall the article helped me understand the best practices when making a design for a form.

            For example, airtable uses good design practices when designing their forms. It follows a single row column and keeps placeholder text below the text input field.
